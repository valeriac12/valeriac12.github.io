# ‚öôÔ∏è Enhancement 2 ‚Äì Algorithms & Data Structures

This enhancement focuses on improving the **efficiency and logic** of my original artifact from **CS 320 ‚Äì Software Test Automation** by optimizing the use of algorithms and data structures.  
The goal was to make the automated testing process faster, more reliable, and less redundant by applying algorithmic thinking to real-world code.

## üîç Description of the Enhancement

In the original artifact, the automation logic worked as intended but relied on repetitive operations and inefficient loops.  
For this enhancement, I refactored sections of the program to use **more effective data structures** and **optimized algorithms** for handling test data and results.

Some of the changes I implemented included:
- Replacing multiple nested loops with a **single, more efficient iteration**.  
- Using **lists and dictionaries** to store and retrieve test data dynamically.  
- Applying **conditional structures** that reduced unnecessary computations.  
- Improving how the script processes and outputs test results.  

These updates made the system perform faster and with fewer resources while keeping the same functionality and accuracy in test execution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Justification

This enhancement demonstrates my understanding of **algorithmic design and computational efficiency**, key areas of computer science.  
By analyzing the time complexity of my code and rethinking the way data was stored and accessed, I achieved significant improvements in performance.

This enhancement aligns with the **third program outcome** of the Computer Science program:  
> ‚ÄúDesign and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution.‚Äù

Through this process, I applied algorithmic problem-solving, demonstrating the ability to assess efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and implement optimized solutions that scale effectively.

## üí° Reflection

This enhancement taught me the value of thinking critically about algorithmic choices.  
Even though my original artifact was functional, analyzing its efficiency revealed opportunities for real improvement.  
It reminded me that in computer science, there are many ways to solve a problem‚Äîbut the best solutions combine clarity, speed, and scalability.

This process also helped me gain confidence in evaluating my own work using **Big O notation** and algorithmic reasoning.  
I now feel better prepared to build systems that are both functional and optimized for real-world performance.
