# üß© Enhancement 1 ‚Äì Software Engineering & Design

This enhancement focuses on improving the **software design** of my original artifact from **CS 320 ‚Äì Software Test Automation**.  
The purpose of this enhancement was to improve the structure, maintainability, and overall organization of the code by applying professional software engineering principles.

## üîç Description of the Enhancement

In the original version of the CS 320 project, the automated testing code worked correctly but lacked a clear and modular structure.  
For this enhancement, I focused on **refactoring the code** to make it easier to maintain, understand, and extend in the future.  

I applied **software design best practices**, such as:
- Breaking down large methods into smaller, reusable ones  
- Improving **naming conventions** to increase clarity  
- Reducing code repetition through **modularization**  
- Adding **inline comments** and method-level documentation for readability  

These changes made the project more consistent with professional standards and easier for other developers or testers to review and update.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Justification

This enhancement demonstrates my ability to apply **software engineering design principles** to create maintainable and scalable systems.  
Through this process, I ensured that the project followed clear logic and was easier to extend in future iterations.

This work aligns with the **first program outcome** of the Computer Science program:  
> ‚ÄúDesign and develop computing solutions using a systematic approach grounded in software engineering principles and best practices.‚Äù

By restructuring the project‚Äôs code and improving its readability, I showed proficiency in developing organized, efficient, and sustainable software solutions.

## üí° Reflection

This enhancement allowed me to better understand the connection between code design and long-term software quality.  
I learned that writing functional code is only one part of software engineering‚Äî**how the code is structured and documented** is just as important.

This experience helped me develop a more professional mindset when writing and maintaining code.  
It also reinforced the importance of planning before implementation, as a good structure reduces complexity and makes future updates easier.
