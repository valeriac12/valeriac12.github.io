# 🗄️ Enhancement 3 – Databases

This enhancement focuses on the **database integration** of my original artifact from **CS 320 – Software Test Automation**.  
The main goal was to improve how the system stores, retrieves, and manages data, ensuring that test results are saved securely and can be analyzed later.

---

## 🔍 Description of the Enhancement

In the original version of my project, test results were generated but not persistently stored.  
For this enhancement, I implemented a **database connection** to store information about each automated test, including:
- The name of each test case  
- Execution date and time  
- Expected vs. actual results  
- Test status (passed or failed)

I used a lightweight database system to handle data persistence efficiently.  
This addition allowed the application to record every test run and later generate reports or comparisons based on historical data.

To ensure data accuracy, I also implemented:
- **Validation checks** before inserting new records  
- **Error handling** for database connection issues  
- **Queries** to retrieve and summarize stored results  

These features brought a new level of functionality and professionalism to the original artifact.

## ⚙️ Justification

This enhancement demonstrates my understanding of **database design, integration, and data management**, which are key aspects of modern software systems.  
By incorporating persistent storage, I transformed a standalone testing program into a more scalable and data-driven solution.

This aligns with the **fifth program outcome** of the Computer Science program:  
> “Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.”

In this enhancement, I considered security and data integrity throughout the process—ensuring that data handling followed best practices and protecting against potential errors or misuse.

## 💡 Reflection

Working on this enhancement helped me understand how powerful it is to combine **software testing with data management**.  
I learned how to establish database connections, design queries, and handle potential errors while ensuring data consistency.

This enhancement also taught me the importance of thinking beyond the immediate functionality of a program.  
Adding a database transformed my project from a simple automation script into a more complete and professional application capable of recording, tracking, and analyzing results.

Through this process, I developed stronger skills in database integration and gained confidence working with structured data.
