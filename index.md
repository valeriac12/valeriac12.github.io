# üß© Professional Self-Assessment

As I reach the end of my Computer Science program at **Southern New Hampshire University**, this capstone project represents the most complete demonstration of my growth, technical skills, and professional identity. Over the course of the program, I have developed my abilities as a software engineer and problem solver, gaining experience in software design, algorithms, databases, and secure coding. Through the enhancements made to my **CS 320 ‚Äì Software Test Automation** project, I have demonstrated mastery of all five program outcomes, which collectively show my readiness to enter the field as a software engineer with a focus on database systems.

## üí° Showcasing My Strengths

Throughout this degree, I have learned how to collaborate effectively in both individual and team settings. In my Agile courses, I experienced the importance of communication between developers, testers, and stakeholders to deliver functional software on time. I also strengthened my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly through written documentation, code comments, and oral presentations such as my **code review video**.

My coursework required me to think critically about how to design efficient, maintainable, and secure software. I became skilled at applying algorithmic principles to improve performance and ensure reliability. For example, by enhancing my CS 320 artifact, I restructured test automation scripts to be more modular and efficient, demonstrating both algorithmic thinking and solid software-design practices.

In addition, I cultivated a **security mindset**. In CS 405 (Secure Coding), I learned how to anticipate vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and data exposure. I applied this same awareness to my test automation project by adding validation steps, handling exceptions properly, and protecting stored test data. These experiences taught me that security is not an afterthought but a foundation of professional software development.

## üéØ Professional Growth and Goals

When I started this program, my background was in **civil engineering**. Transitioning to computer science challenged me to learn new concepts‚Äîfrom coding and algorithms to systems architecture and database management. Over time, I discovered a strong interest in both **software engineering** and **database administration**, areas that combine analytical thinking, logic, and precision.

My goal is to continue building expertise as a **Database Administrator or Software Engineer**, focusing on developing secure, efficient systems that manage and analyze data effectively. The ePortfolio I built demonstrates these capabilities with real, functional examples of code and analysis.

## üß† Artifacts Overview

To show my growth across the three key categories of computer science, I selected a single artifact‚Äîmy **CS 320 Software Test Automation project**‚Äîand enhanced it in three distinct ways:

- **Software Engineering and Design:** I restructured the project‚Äôs architecture using better modularization and naming conventions, improving readability and maintainability.  
- **Algorithms and Data Structures:** I optimized the testing logic to reduce redundancy, making the test execution more efficient by implementing dynamic data structures.  
- **Databases:** I expanded the project to connect with a database that stores test results, improving data management and analysis capabilities.

Each enhancement required me to plan, test, and refine my code using professional tools and workflows such as version control with **GitHub**, **unit testing frameworks**, and **CI/CD automation principles**.

These enhancements together show my ability to design, analyze, and implement reliable software while demonstrating my readiness to apply these skills in professional environments.

## üèÅ Conclusion

The **CS 499 Capstone** has been the most valuable experience of my academic journey because it required me to integrate everything I have learned‚Äîsoftware design, testing, data structures, security, and communication‚Äîinto one cohesive presentation. The process of enhancing my CS 320 project and creating my ePortfolio helped me see how far I have come and how confident I now feel in my technical and professional abilities.

I am proud of the progress I have made and excited to apply these skills in my future career. My ePortfolio serves not only as evidence of my learning but also as a reflection of my passion for continuous improvement, collaboration, and creating software that delivers value and reliability.
