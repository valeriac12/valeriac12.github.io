## üîç Overview
In the code review video, I walk through:
- The **existing functionality** of the project before enhancements.
- A **code analysis** identifying areas for improvement in structure, efficiency, testing, and security.
- The **planned enhancements**, which align with the three main categories of the Computer Science program:
  1. **Software Engineering & Design**
  2. **Algorithms & Data Structures**
  3. **Databases**

Each section highlights my professional reasoning process, testing strategies, and the methods I used to improve overall performance, maintainability, and security.
